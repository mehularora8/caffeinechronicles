The Quarters Coffee House,"Vibe: 5 / 5. This place is the perfect working environment. It’s unfortunate that they close early, because if not I’d work here for hours and hours. It’s a residential house (very nice house, might I add) where the bottom floor has been converted into a cafe. Great decor, good vibes, good music. 

Taste: 5 / 5. The coffee was also great, it was a hot day and the iced latte is what I needed. Was not watered down in the slightest.",Bay Area,5 - Would drive many hours to get to this place,"1015 Walnut Ave, Vallejo, CA 94592","{'lat': 38.0992969, 'lon': -122.27365959292662}"
The lighthouse,Vibe: 5/5. This is hidden away between huge corporate buildings but after stepping in you can’t tell you’re in the heart of capitalism. Very cozy and the people are super friendly! Taste: 4/5. I got the raspberry latte which was tasty but the raspberry syrup was a bit overpowering.

Taste: 5 / 5. Their menu has traditional coffee drinks, but has location inspired coffee drinks on top. I got the Manila, which was a Ube + Mango + Coconut drink, which I expected to be very sweet but was incredibly balanced and tasted great.

Red Rock Coffee,"Vibe: 5 / 5. Whatever you’re looking to do, this place is super cool. If you’re there to work, they have an upper area to do just that or if you’re there to hang out they have a bunch of seating. The place is well lit and the staff is very chill.

Taste: 3 / 5. The coffee was okay. The espresso taste was there, but it was a little too milky. ",Bay Area,3 - Would visit again if I’m in the area,"201 Castro St, Mountain View, CA 94041","{'lat': 37.3936438, 'lon': -122.0788638}"

HITW Coffee,"Vibe: 5 / 5. Honestly, this was a fascinating place, definitely one if its kind of all the places I’ve been to so far. The barista there was incredible, she chatted with us for a while while our coffee was being made (apparently it’s just 1 person that runs the shop, the owner aside). She told us the lore of how their specialty, the coco cold brew came to be - one of their hungover neighbors would come to the shop, get a coconut water and then cold brew before their way out. One day, they were running late, so they mixed the two and voila, the unique drink was formed. The environment was very comfortable, reminded me of a regular tea stall you might go to on your way out of the house in India. 

Taste: 5 / 5. My friend ordered the coco cold brew and that was fascinating. Had 3 layers of taste, and it was honestly unlike anything I’d had before. Their espresso machine wasn’t working and I got the North Beach, and despite not being the biggest non-espresso coffee drinker, this was fantastic. The notes came through in the pour over, it was sweet but just the right amount.

Damnfine Coffee,"Vibe: 5 / 5: It was almost hard to find lol, but it’s super cozy, great little setup. The one downside is that there isn’t much seating, but it’s a few blocks from the beach so just headed there to sip my coffee. Taste: 4 / 5: Super nice coffee! Smooth texture, pretty balanced espresso taste (which does mean that it wasn’t as bold as I like it, but it was still damn fine.)

Taste: 5 / 5! Got a honey hazelnut latte, it hit the spot. Right what I needed at the time, not terribly sweet, not overpowering flavors, great taste.

Four Barrel Coffee,"Vibe: 5 / 5. Fascinating space, loved it! They have a roastery in the back, it was very spacious and and was well lit. Super cute cups too lol. 
Taste: 4 / 5. The foam was super acidic which made the taste bad to begin with, but after I stirred it in, the coffee was awesome. Espresso tasted light and sweet and the consistency was really nice.

Earth Tone Cafe,"Vibe: 5 / 5. This place is how I’d like to set up my eventual cafe. It has only a few spots to sit, but each one of them is very very cozy. They always have great music and great vibes. 

Taste: 5 / 5. Their banana latte might be one of my favorite coffee drinks. They used mashed bananas so the drink itself is chunky, which I really like. I haven’t seen this being done in many other coffee places, though I’m sure they’re not the first.

Kopiku Coffee,"Vibe: 4 / 5. I came to this place after I saw a reel about it, which probably explains the long line when I got there. Waited for about 15 minutes. The coffee was expensive, but the sitting area (if you can snag a spot) was cute.
Taste: 5 / 5. I got the pandan latte w a double shot and it was extremely tasty. It was light, but I could distinctly taste the espresso which had a distinct flavor.

Taste: 4/5. Got a cappuccino, didn’t expect chocolate in it but it worked nonetheless. The coffee taste was good though was masked by the chocolate. ",SF,4 - Would come again if I’m anywhere in the city,"1525 Union St, San Francisco, CA 94123","{'lat': 37.7982178, 'lon': -122.4266786}"
Sana’a Coffee,"Vibe: 4 / 5. Can see this being a 5 for a bunch of people, the place is massive, recently opened so it’s very clean, the decor is clean and the layout is spacious. Decor is traditional - my only down side is that this would probably not be a work 8 hours a day kinda space. Taste: 4 / 5. Got the sana’a latte. It’s bold. Interesting. Have not tasted anything like this before.
