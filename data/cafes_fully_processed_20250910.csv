HITW Coffee,"Vibe: 5 / 5. Honestly, this was a fascinating place, definitely one if its kind of all the places I’ve been to so far.

She told us the lore of how their specialty, the coco cold brew came to be - one of their hungover neighbors would come to the shop, get a coconut water and then cold brew before their way out. One day, they were running late, so they mixed the two and voila, the unique drink was formed. The environment was very comfortable, reminded me of a regular tea stall you might go to on your way out of the house in India. 

Taste: 5 / 5. My friend ordered the coco cold brew and that was fascinating. Had 3 layers of taste, and it was honestly unlike anything I’d had before.

Artly Coffee,"Vibe: 2 / 5. 
This was small and not someplace I would stop to work while I drink my coffee. Felt barren and very robotic (bc it literally was).

Taste: 4 / 5.
The coffee was actually great. Tasted fantastic, latte felt very much like a latte, everything blended together perfectly.

Grumpy Bean coffee,"Vibe: 4 / 5. Modern decor that I really like! Located on a cute little corner. Enough seating space which honestly could be utilized better but pretty good place to work or just chill. 
Taste: 3 / 5. Pretty good latte but the flavor was too dominated by milk. Good foam, but would’ve liked it to be a little stronger.
