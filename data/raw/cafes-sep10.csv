CoffeeShop Micro Roastery,"Vibe: 4 / 5. Lots of natural light but a little cramped seating wise. Great outdoor seating though – place felt like it served a ton of regulars. It constantly smells like roasted beans, which was incredibly fun for me, but may not be for everyone.

Taste: 4 / 5. Good coffee – interestingly made my iced coffee with hot foamed milk which added an interesting texture to it that I enjoyed. ",SF,3 - Would visit again if I’m in the area,"900 22nd St, San Francisco, CA 94107",Wifi but no outlets

Taste: 4 / 5. I’d wanted to try them for a while. They have a big roastery in another part of the city. Didn’t disappoint! Good coffee, was balanced. Little on the sweeter side and good aftertaste.

Martha and Bros Coffee,"Vibe: 4 / 5. Fun fact: this was the first cafe I visited after moving to SF. This is a very cozy spot. They don’t have wifi, but that doesn’t stop them from making it a great place to work / read. 
Taste: 3 / 5. I honestly thought the coffee was way too diluted. Still I give them the benefit of the doubt that it was a one-off.  ",SF,2 - Would stop by if I stumble upon this place again,"3850 24th St, San Francisco, CA 94114",

Java Beach at the zoo,"Vibe: 4 / 5. This felt like a classic beach town coffee shop. Breezy, very well lit. Couldn’t sit here to work but I don’t think that’s the intended effect. 

Taste: 3 / 5. The coffee was okay. I got a cappuccino which was closer to a latte, which is fine, but I suppose the takeaway is that expect your drinks to feel a little diluted. ",SF,2 - Would stop by if I stumble upon this place again,"2650 Sloat Blvd, San Francisco, CA 94116",
The Beanery,"Vibe: 3 / 5. Great lighting, but this place was uninspiring. Felt like a beat down spot where no one, including the people running the place, wanted to be.

Taste: 5 / 5. Their banana latte might be one of my favorite coffee drinks. They used mashed bananas so the drink itself is chunky, which I really like. I haven’t seen this being done in many other coffee places, though I’m sure they’re not the first.

California Kahve - Presidio,"Vibe: 3 / 5. The surrounding area is great, but the truck itself is in a heavily trafficked spot where everyone’s coming to grab lunch. The walk afterwards is pristine though. 

Taste: 3 / 5. I got their seasonal special but received a matcha instead. The matcha was okay, but was too milky and the matcha taste (or any other flavor, which were added) didn’t come through at all.

The Buoy,"Vibe: 5 / 5. Super boujee, super fancy but also super cozy. A very unsuspecting spot, hard to tell what it is but once you’re inside it’s a great place to work and hang out. 

Taste: 4 / 5. I got a toasted coconut latte. The coconut flavor was good but REALLY strong. The first few sips were great, but once the flavor settled a little bit the last few were hard to get through. ",SF,3 - Would visit again if I’m in the area,"22 Franklin St, San Francisco, CA 94102",

Telve Cafe,"Vibe: 5 / 5. There’s a super cozy corner which I unfortunately didn’t get to sit in but I knew I’d spent a long time in if I did. Great wifi, great working atmosphere, good vibes. They had a sand heating setup for Turkish coffee which was quite cool too.

Taste: 4 / 5. My first taste of Turkish Coffee! It was pitched to me as “bold as espresso but not as bitter” and honestly held completely true to the description. I still prefer espresso, but definitely worth the experience.",SF,3 - Would visit again if I’m in the area,"2163 Union St, San Francisco, CA 94123",
Blackbird Bookstore and Cafe,"Vibe: 5 / 5. It’s a bookstore, of course it has great vibes. This place has a very nice backyard (with a deconstructable golden gate bridge) and super cute seating which is private enough despite being in a shared space. Very cool design. 

Taste: 3 / 5. Their cortado was VERY bold. And by that I mean the espresso taste was a little overpowering. A great tasting espresso, but overpowering nonetheless. ",SF,3 - Would visit again if I’m in the area,"4541 Irving St, San Francisco, CA 94122",
Cento Coffee Systeme D,"Vibe: 5 / 5. This place is energizing!! It’s located in the Center for Architecture + Design so naturally it has amazing decor.

Motoring Cafe,"Vibe: 5/5. This place is sick! There are multiple cars on display (which are apparently rotated through, though I can’t confirm) but you can sit inside one of the cars too. Great place to work, super spacious and super well lit. 

Taste: 4/5. Got a cappuccino, didn’t expect chocolate in it but it worked nonetheless. The coffee taste was good though was masked by the chocolate. ",SF,4 - Would come again if I’m anywhere in the city,"1525 Union St, San Francisco, CA 94123",Wifi + Seating + Outlets

Equator Coffees,"Vibe: 5 / 5. This is the Equator shack in Fort mason. I really like this location because you can go for a walk along the pier right after grabbing coffee. There’s no real place to sit, but it’s a great spot to stop by.

Taste: 3 / 5. I got their Habibi latte, which had vanilla + cinnamon + something I forget. Personally, the Sana’a latte at Sana’a cafe is better.

Taste: 4 / 5: Super nice coffee! Smooth texture, pretty balanced espresso taste (which does mean that it wasn’t as bold as I like it, but it was still damn fine.) ",SF,4 - Would come again if I’m anywhere in the city,"4033 Judah St, San Francisco, CA 94122",No Seating

HITW Coffee,"Vibe: 5 / 5. Honestly, this was a fascinating place, definitely one if its kind of all the places I’ve been to so far. The barista there was incredible, she chatted with us for a while while our coffee was being made (apparently it’s just 1 person that runs the shop, the owner aside). She told us the lore of how their specialty, the coco cold brew came to be - one of their hungover neighbors would come to the shop, get a coconut water and then cold brew before their way out. One day, they were running late, so they mixed the two and voila, the unique drink was formed. The environment was very comfortable, reminded me of a regular tea stall you might go to on your way out of the house in India. 

Taste: 5 / 5. My friend ordered the coco cold brew and that was fascinating. Had 3 layers of taste, and it was honestly unlike anything I’d had before. Their espresso machine wasn’t working and I got the North Beach, and despite not being the biggest non-espresso coffee drinker, this was fantastic. The notes came through in the pour over, it was sweet but just the right amount. ",SF,6 - Would fly in to come to this place again,"524 Union St, San Francisco, CA 94133",No Seating
The Beanery,"Vibe: 3 / 5: Cute little shop with good outdoor seating, felt very homey with people just vibing. The vibes felt off with the barista though, they were rushing me through my order like they just wanted me out of there. Taste: 3 / 5. Nothing spectacular, but I liked the addition of foam on top of my iced latte. Tasted pretty solid. ",SF,2 - Would stop by if I stumble upon this place again,"1307 9th Ave

Sana’a Coffee,"Vibe: 4 / 5. Can see this being a 5 for a bunch of people, the place is massive, recently opened so it’s very clean, the decor is clean and the layout is spacious. Decor is traditional - my only down side is that this would probably not be a work 8 hours a day kinda space. Taste: 4 / 5. Got the sana’a latte. It’s bold. Interesting. Have not tasted anything like this before. It has cardamom and some other spices in it which gives it a very unique flavor. 4 / 5 because it was $7.20 🥲",SF,4 - Would come again if I’m anywhere in the city,"199 New Montgomery St
