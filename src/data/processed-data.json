The barista there was incredible, she chatted with us for a while while our coffee was being made (apparently it’s just 1 person that runs the shop, the owner aside). She told us the lore of how their specialty, the coco cold brew came to be - one of their hungover neighbors would come to the shop, get a coconut water and then cold brew before their way out. One day, they were running late, so they mixed the two and voila, the unique drink was formed. The environment was very comfortable, reminded me of a regular tea stall you might go to on your way out of the house in India.","taste":"My friend ordered the coco cold brew and that was fascinating. Had 3 layers of taste, and it was honestly unlike anything I’d had before.
